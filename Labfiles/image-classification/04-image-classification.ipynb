    "\n",
    "### Image Quality Guidelines:\n",
    "- **Variety**: Include images with different angles, lighting, and backgrounds\n",
    "- **Quality**: Use clear, well-lit images (minimum 256x256 pixels)\n",
    "- **Quantity**: At least 50 images per tag for good performance\n",
    "- **Balance**: Try to have similar numbers of images for each tag\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Improvement Strategies:\n",
    "1. **Add negative examples**: Include images that should NOT be classified\n",
    "2. **Review misclassifications**: Identify patterns in errors\n",
    "3. **Adjust probability threshold**: Balance precision vs recall\n",
    "4. **Use appropriate domain**: Choose specialized domains (Food, Retail, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "- Monitor prediction confidence scores\n",
    "- Implement fallback logic for low confidence predictions\n",
    "- Regularly retrain with new data\n",
    "- Version control your models (track publish names)"
